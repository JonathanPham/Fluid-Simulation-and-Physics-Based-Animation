Projects and Resources on Physics (Physically) based animation

### Mostly referred to, visited and informative website on physics based animation:
* [Best collection and resource on Physics Based Animation](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com).


### Since the area is pretty big, GET STARTED WITH:
* **Physics based fluid simulation**.
* [Publications on Physics based fluid simulation from RWTH Aachen](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0560_0559_0558_051_0555_0554_0549_054/).
* Book on [Fluid Engine Development](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org), it's [documentation](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org/documentation/) and [github code link for the book](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev). **This book explains how to create a fluid simulation engine from scratch.**
* Worth mentioning twoice is [a nice resource website on physics based animation](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com) and its [recommended collection of books](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/books-2/).
* [Youtube : Physics based animation course videos from Ladislav Kavan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_a9tY9IhJuM2dIVCH_ZC0Pn5871eDY7_).

### Resources on Fluid Simulation:
* [SPlisHSPlasH is an open-source library for the physically-based simulation of fluids from RWTH Aachen](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH).
* [Fluid simulation publications](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0560_0559_0558_051_0555_0554_0549_054/).
* [Physics simulation in computer graphics lab in ETH Zurich](https://graphics.ethz.ch/research/physics_simulation/) also [realted tutorials from ETH Zurich](https://graphics.ethz.ch/publications/tutorials.php) has lecture notes and pdf's.

### Resources on related Computer Graphics and Physics based animation materials:
* [Computer Graphics realted tutorials from ETH Zurich](https://graphics.ethz.ch/publications/tutorials.php) has lecture notes and pdf's.
* [Main resources page for the book Real-Time Rendering, Fourth Edition, by Tomas Akenine-MÃ¶ller](http://www.realtimerendering.com/).
* [Physics based animation course from university of waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/courses/CS888_2014/). Also go to its extra reading materials for other resources.
* [Ke-Sen Huang's Home Page for realtime rendering resources](http://kesen.realtimerendering.com).
