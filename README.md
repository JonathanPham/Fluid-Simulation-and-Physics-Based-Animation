# Physics-Based-Animation & Fluid Simulation Engine
Projects and Resources on Physics (Physically) based animation

### Mostly referred to, visited and informative website on physics based animation:
* [Best collection and resource on Physics Based Animation](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com).


### Since the area is pretty big, GET STARTED WITH:
* **Physics based fluid simulation**.
* Book on [Fluid Engine Development](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org), explains how to create a fluid simulation engine from scratch. It's [documentation](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org/documentation/) and [github code link for the book](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev). **This book explains how to create a fluid simulation engine from scratch.**
* Coursera course on [Simulation and modeling of natural processes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modeling-simulation-natural-processes#syllabus). This course gives you an introduction to modeling methods and simulation tools for a wide range of natural phenomena. The different methodologies that will be presented here can be applied to very wide range of topics such as fluid motion, stellar dynamics, population evolution, ...

### Resources on Fluid Simulation:
* [SPlisHSPlasH is an open-source library for the physically-based simulation of fluids from RWTH Aachen](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH).
* [Publications on Physics based fluid simulation from RWTH Aachen](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0560_0559_0558_051_0555_0554_0549_054/).
* Worth mentioning twoice is [a nice resource website on physics based animation](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com) and its [recommended collection of books](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/books-2/).
* [Youtube : Physics based animation course videos from Ladislav Kavan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_a9tY9IhJuM2dIVCH_ZC0Pn5871eDY7_).
* [Physics simulation in computer graphics lab in ETH Zurich](https://graphics.ethz.ch/research/physics_simulation/) also [realted tutorials from ETH Zurich](https://graphics.ethz.ch/publications/tutorials.php) has lecture notes and pdf's.
* [Learning Path for a Game Engine Programmer](https://miloyip.github.io/game-programmer/game-programmer.pdf).
