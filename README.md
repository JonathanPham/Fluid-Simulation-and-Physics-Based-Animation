### Since the area is pretty big, GET STARTED WITH:
* **Physics based fluid simulation**.
* [Publications on Physics based fluid simulation from RWTH Aachen](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0560_0559_0558_051_0555_0554_0549_054/).
* Book on [Fluid Engine Development](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org), it's [documentation](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org/documentation/) and [github code link for the book](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev).
